Annotate the following flamenco periodical articles using the collapsed codebook.

Be conservative. Prioritize precision over recall.

Rules:
- Annotate only the visible article_text_for_review.
- Do not infer from title, metadata, periodical, author identity, or missing text.
- Default to 0–3 codes per article.
- Use 4–6 codes only when clearly distinct evidence spans support different discourse functions.
- Never assign more than 6 codes.
- Do not emit low-confidence codes.
- Keywords are not enough. A code requires a discourse function: the passage must evaluate, authorize, exclude, preserve, teach, transmit, rank, criticize, or define belonging/authority.
- Every emitted code must include family, code, confidence, evidence_quote, target, and rationale.
- If no code is clearly supported, return codes: [] and no_relevant_discourse: true.
- If the text is too short, OCR-damaged, or insufficient for judgment, set insufficient_context: true.
- Put weak or ambiguous possibilities in possible_but_not_emitted, not in codes.

Allowed families and codes:
AUTH: AUTH_01, AUTH_02, AUTH_03, AUTH_04
HERIT: HERIT_01, HERIT_02, HERIT_03
PED: PED_01, PED_02, PED_03
COMM: COMM_01, COMM_02, COMM_03, COMM_04
CRIT: CRIT_01, CRIT_02, CRIT_03, CRIT_04

Return valid JSON only, as an array with one object per article_id:
